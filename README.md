# Result Analysis and Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Result Analysis and Performance Dashboard** is a full-stack web application designed to analyze student performance and visualize academic results through an interactive dashboard.

The system allows users to securely log in, access student result data, and view performance insights such as subject-wise scores, overall performance, and trends using graphical visualizations.

This project aims to simplify academic result analysis and help educators or administrators identify high-performing students, weak subjects, and overall class performance.
